/**

As a customer, I would like to give my car to a parking boy so that he can help me park and fetch it.

AC1: The parking boy can park a car into the parking lot and returns a parking ticket.
 The customer can give the parking ticket back to the parking boy to fetch the car.

AC2: The parking boy can park multiple cars into the parking lot.
 And can fetch right car using correspond ticket.

AC3: If the customer gives a wrong ticket (the parking boy did not provide the ticket)
 or does not give a ticket. Then no car should be fetched.

AC4: If the customer gives a ticket that has already been used.
 Then no car should be fetched.

AC5: The parking lot has a capacity (the default capacity of a parking lot is 10).
 If there is no position, then the user cannot park the car into it. Thus (s)he will not get any ticket.

 --- above case = demo showed ---

There are some cases which are not a requirement but may happen technically
Passing a parked car to a parking boy. (OK)
Passing a null car to a parking boy. (OK)
